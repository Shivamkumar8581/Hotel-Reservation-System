# Hotel-Reservation-System
The Hotel Reservation System is a simple, menu-driven application developed in C to demonstrate the concepts of file handling, structures, and console-based programming. It provides a basic yet practical solution for managing hotel room reservations, cancellations, and availability tracking.
Features

Admin Panel

Add new rooms with details such as room number, type (Single/Double/Deluxe), and price.

Technical Highlights

Written in C programming language.

Uses structures for efficient data organization.

Implements file handling for permanent storage of hotel and booking information.

Menu-driven interface for ease of use.

Purpose

This project was designed for academic learning to strengthen concepts of C programming, particularly file operations, data structures, and modular design. It simulates a real-world scenario of hotel operations, making it both educational and practical.
